This repository contains project files for the Holberton AirBnB clone project!
At a high level, the point of this project is to generate a mostly-functional AirBnB clone.

This project took place across four months, with four parts each.

## Part 1 - Command Interpreter
The first week involves building a Python console to interface with the higher-level aspects of the program. It uses a JSON file structure which will be replaced later by an actual SQL database.

This is a test code block!
